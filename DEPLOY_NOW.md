## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Vercel deployment fails
- Make sure you're logged in: `vercel whoami`
- Check logs: `vercel logs`
- Verify environment variable is set in dashboard

### Railway deployment fails
- Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify `ADDRESS` variable is set
- Make sure you're in the correct directory

### "Module not found" error
- This is normal if x402 installation fails locally
- Cloud platforms have Python 3.11 and will work fine
- Don't worry about local Python 3.9 compatibility

### Payment not working
- Verify `ADDRESS` environment variable is set
- Check the health endpoint
- Ensure you're using mainnet USDC
- Try testnet first for testing
